# LABVIEW Project

## Overview
This project is a **Trigonometric Identity Verification** system implemented using **LabVIEW**. It demonstrates the use of LabVIEW for mathematical computations, graphical visualization, and real-time data processing. The project verifies standard trigonometric identities by comparing calculated and expected values.

## Features
- Implements trigonometric identity verification.
- Uses LabVIEW's graphical programming environment.
- Provides real-time computation and visualization.
- User-friendly interface with input fields and result display.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install **LabVIEW** (Ensure you have at least the required version to support the VI files).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DeepakGaut/LABVIEW.git
   ```
3. Open the `.vi` file in LabVIEW.
4. Run the VI and interact with the system.

## Usage
1. Enter the required input values.
2. The system will compute and verify trigonometric identities.
3. View the graphical representation and numerical results.
